# Deep Learning Specialization with PyTorch

These are my personal implementations for the assignments on the Deep Learning Specialization using PyTorch. Please see the official Coursera listing at [this link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). 

The assignments (originally in TensorFlow) generally follow the notebooks found [here](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization). For another set of implementations in PyTorch, check out furkanu's repo [here](https://github.com/furkanu/deeplearning.ai-pytorch).

The notebooks in this project were developed in PyTorch 1.12.1.

### Disclaimer

I claim no ownership of the ideas and projects presented in the notebooks --- much of the credit goes to the teams at deeplearning.ai. This repository is meant to be another resource for people who hope to complete the assignments using PyTorch.
